Titanic_survival Prediction
Project Overview:
We'll build a model to predict whether a passenger survived on the Titanic based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more. This project will demonstrate basic data science workflow:

1.Loading and Exploring the Dataset
2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4.Building a Machine Learning Model
5.Model Evaluation
